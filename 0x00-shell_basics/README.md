# 0x00. Shell, Basics - DevOps Project

This project is part of the DevOps curriculum and focuses on gaining proficiency in working with the shell, particularly Bash, in a Linux environment. The project consists of a series of tasks that cover various aspects of shell navigation, file manipulation, and command usage.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain a deep understanding of shell basics and navigation.
- Learn how to work with files, directories, and symbolic links.
- Become proficient in using common shell commands.
- Explore keyboard shortcuts for Bash.
- Understand the importance of good practices in shell scripting.

## Project Structure

The project contains a series of scripts, each addressing specific tasks related to shell basics. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **Where am I?**: Print the absolute path name of the current working directory.

2. **What's in there?**: Display the contents list of your current directory.

3. **There is no place like home**: Write a script that changes the working directory to the user's home directory.

4. **The long format**: Display current directory contents in a long format.

5. **Hidden files**: Display current directory contents, including hidden files, using the long format.

6. **I love numbers**: Display current directory contents in a long format with user and group IDs displayed numerically, including hidden files.

7. **Welcome**: Create a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.

8. **Betty in my first directory**: Move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.

9. **Bye bye Betty**: Delete the file betty from /tmp/my_first_directory.

10. **Back to the future**: Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one.

11. **Lists**: List all files (including hidden ones) in the current directory, parent directory, and /boot directory in long format.

12. **File type**: Print the type of the file named iamafile located in the /tmp directory.

13. **We are symbols, and inhabit symbols**: Create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__, in the current working directory.

14. **Copy HTML files**: Copy all HTML files from the current working directory to the parent directory, preserving newer versions.

15. **Let's move**: Move all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u.

16. **Clean Emacs**: Delete all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.

17. **Tree**: Create the directories welcome/, welcome/to/, and welcome/to/school in the current directory.

18. **Life is a series of commas, not periods**: Write a command that lists all files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas.

19. **File type: School**: Create a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect School data files.

## Requirements and Guidelines

- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Ensure that scripts are exactly two lines long.
- End all files with a new line.
- Start all scripts with `#!/bin/bash`.
- Provide a README.md file with a description of the repository and explanations of each script.
- Avoid using backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;` in your scripts.
- Make all scripts executable using `chmod`.
- Ensure that scripts adhere to good coding practices and avoid plagiarism.

- Ensure that scripts are exactly two lines long.
- End all files with a new line.
- Start all scripts with `#!/bin/bash`.
- Provide a README.md file with a description of the repository and explanations of each script.
- Avoid using backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;` in your scripts.
- Make all scripts executable using `chmod`.

# How to Create a Diagram Illustrating Web Request Processes

## Overview
This guide explains how to create a diagram illustrating the sequence of events from when a user types 'https://www.google.com' in a web browser to receiving the web page. This diagram will help visualize complex interactions such as DNS resolution, TCP/IP connections, and the role of firewalls, among others.

## Tools Required
You can use any of the following tools to create your diagram:
- Gliffy
- Lucidchart
- Draw.io
- Microsoft Visio

## Diagram Creation Steps

### 1. **Start Your Diagram Tool**
   - Open your chosen diagram tool and select a blank template or a flowchart template.

### 2. **Draw the User Action**
   - Represent the user or the browser where the URL is typed.
   - Use an arrow to denote action flow from the user to the internet.

### 3. **DNS Resolution**
   - Add a 'DNS Server' block.
   - Connect with an arrow labeled "DNS Lookup" from the browser.
   - Return an arrow labeled "IP Address" to represent the DNS response.

### 4. **TCP/IP Connection**
   - Show this connection reaching the server IP on the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS).

### 5. **Encryption via HTTPS/SSL**
   - Indicate encryption with a labeled arrow "Encrypted Traffic (HTTPS/SSL)".

### 6. **Firewall**
   - Insert a 'Firewall' block.
   - Show traffic passing through with directional arrows.

### 7. **Load Balancer**
   - Place a 'Load Balancer' block after the firewall.
   - Indicate distribution of requests.

### 8. **Web Server Interaction**
   - Connect the load balancer to a 'Web Server'.
   - Indicate processing of the request.

### 9. **Application Server Dynamics**
   - Arrow from web server to 'Application Server'.
   - Show page generation here.

### 10. **Database Interaction**
   - Connect 'Application Server' to 'Database'.
   - Show data requests and responses.

### 11. **Response to User**
   - Arrow back from web server/application server to the user's browser labeled "Web Page".

## Finalizing and Sharing Your Diagram
   - Ensure all components are clearly labeled and the flow is logical.
   - Export the diagram as an image or PDF.
   - Upload the diagram to an image hosting service or directly in your GitHub repository.
   - Use the Markdown format to embed the image in your documentation:

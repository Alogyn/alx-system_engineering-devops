# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters - DevOps Project

This project is a part of the DevOps curriculum and aims to enhance your proficiency in working with the shell, specifically Bash, within a Linux environment. Throughout this project, you will engage in tasks that explore various aspects of shell commands, file manipulation, and input/output redirection.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a deep understanding of shell commands and their applications.
- Gain familiarity with essential commands like `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, and `tr`.
- Learn to redirect standard input/output to and from files.
- Discover how to chain commands and filters using redirections.
- Acquire knowledge about special characters and their usage in the shell

## Project Structure

The project contains a series of scripts, each addressing specific tasks related to shell redirections. Here's a brief overview of the tasks:

0. **[Hello World:](hahaha)** Write a script that prints "Hello, World" followed by a new line to the standard output.

1. **[Confused Smiley:](hahaha)** Write a script that displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'.

2. **[Let's Display a File:](hahaha)** Display the content of the /etc/passwd file.

3. **[What About 2?:](hahaha)** Display the content of both /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts files.

4. **[Last Lines of a File:](hahaha)** Display the last 10 lines of the /etc/passwd file.

5. **[I'd Prefer the First Ones Actually:](hahaha)** Display the first 10 lines of the /etc/passwd file.

6. **[Line #2:](hahaha)** Display the third line of the file iacta.

7. **[It is a Good File That Cuts Iron Without Making a Noise:](hahaha)** Create a shell script that creates a file named exactly \*\\'"Best School"\'\\*$\?\*\*\*\*\*:) containing the text "Best School" ending with a new line.

8. **[Save Current State of Directory:](hahaha)** Write a script that writes into the file ls_cwd_content the result of the command ls -la. If the file ls_cwd_content already exists, it should be overwritten. If the file ls_cwd_content does not exist, create it.

9. **[Duplicate Last Line:](hahaha)** Write a script that duplicates the last line of the file iacta.

10. **[No More JavaScript:](hahaha)** Write a script that deletes all the regular files (not directories) with a .js extension that are present in the current directory and all its subfolders.

11. **[Don't Just Count Your Directories, Make Your Directories Count:](hahaha)** Write a script that counts the number of directories and sub-directories in the current directory. Hidden directories should be counted, and the current and parent directories should not be taken into account.

12. **[What’s New:](hahaha)** Create a script that displays the 10 newest files in the current directory, one file per line, sorted from newest to oldest.

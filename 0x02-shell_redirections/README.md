# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters - DevOps Projec

This project is a part of the DevOps curriculum and aims to enhance your proficiency in working with the shell, specifically Bash, within a Linux environment. Throughout this project, you will engage in tasks that explore various aspects of shell commands, file manipulation, and input/output redirection.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop a deep understanding of shell commands and their applications.
- Gain familiarity with essential commands like `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, and `tr`.
- Learn to redirect standard input/output to and from files.
- Discover how to chain commands and filters using redirections.
- Acquire knowledge about special characters and their usage in the shell

    - **[100-empty_casks:](100-empty_casks)** Write a command that finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories. List only the names of the files and directories (not the entire path).

24. **A gif is worth ten thousand words**
    - **[101-gifs:](101-gifs)** Write a script that lists all the files with a .gif extension in the current directory and all its sub-directories. List only regular files (not directories) and sort them by byte values in a case-insensitive manner.

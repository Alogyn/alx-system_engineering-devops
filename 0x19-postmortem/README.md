## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**  
Start: June 1, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC  
End: June 1, 2024, 1:30 PM UTC  
Total Duration: 3 hours 30 minutes

**Impact:**  
The XYZ E-commerce platform experienced a full outage, preventing users from accessing the website and mobile app. Approximately 90% of the user base (over 1 million users) were affected, unable to browse products, make purchases, or access their accounts.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to a cascading failure across all web servers. (Yes, the load balancer decided to go rogue and mess things up!)

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM:** Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating high error rates and service unavailability.  
  
- **10:05 AM:** Initial investigation began; assumption was a database overload due to high traffic.  

- **10:15 AM:** Database performance metrics checked; no unusual activity found.

- **10:30 AM:** Network team alerted; began checking network components and firewall settings.  

- **11:00 AM:** Misleading path: suspected DDoS attack; traffic analyzed, ruled out as a cause.  

- **11:30 AM:** Escalated to infrastructure team; deeper investigation into server logs.  

- **12:00 PM:** Identified load balancer misconfiguration; all traffic was incorrectly routed, causing server overload.

- **12:15 PM:** Began reconfiguring the load balancer settings.

- **1:00 PM:** Load balancer configuration updated and tested; services started recovering.

- **1:30 PM:** Full service restored; monitoring continued for stability.  

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The misconfiguration in the load balancer was due to a recent update that inadvertently set all server weights to zero except one. This caused all traffic to be directed to a single server, which quickly became overwhelmed and crashed. The failure cascaded as other servers tried to take on the load but were also misconfigured to handle minimal traffic. (Picture a single server crying out, "I can't handle this alone!")

**Resolution:**  
The load balancer settings were corrected by reassigning appropriate weights to all servers. Configuration changes were tested in a staging environment before being applied to production. A rolling restart of web servers was performed to ensure they picked up the new configuration.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Management:** Implement a more rigorous review and testing process for configuration changes.
2. **Automated Configuration Audits:** Set up automated checks to detect and alert on anomalous load balancer settings.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Improve monitoring to detect load distribution issues earlier.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
- Patch the load balancer software to the latest version to ensure all known bugs are fixed.
- Implement a configuration validation script that runs before any changes are applied.
- Add comprehensive monitoring for load balancer traffic patterns and alerting for unusual traffic distributions.
- Conduct training sessions for the DevOps team on best practices for load balancer management.
- Schedule regular reviews of load balancer configurations and performance metrics.
